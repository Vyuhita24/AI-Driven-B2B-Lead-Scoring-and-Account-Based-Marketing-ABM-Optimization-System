### 1. **Scikit-Learn is primarily focused on:**
   - **Answer:** Traditional Machine Learning  
     Scikit-Learn is a library for traditional machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, clustering, and preprocessing.

### 2. **In Scikit-Learn, what is the role of a model class?**
   - **Answer:** It represents a machine learning algorithm and its associated methods.  
     A model class (e.g., `RandomForestClassifier`, `LinearRegression`) encapsulates the algorithm and provides methods for training, prediction, and evaluation.

### 3. **Scikit-Learn is built on top of which Python libraries?**
   - **Answer:** NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib  
     These libraries provide the foundational operations for numerical computations, scientific computing, and basic visualization that Scikit-Learn leverages.

### 4. **What does the following line of code achieve in Scikit-Learn?**
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   classification_model = RandomForestClassifier()
   ```
   - **Answer:** It creates an instance of a random forest classifier for classification tasks.  
     This initializes a Random Forest model, which can be used for training on classification problems.

### 5. **What is the purpose of the following code in Scikit-Learn?**
   ```python
   from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
   classification_model = KNeighborsClassifier()
   ```
   - **Answer:** It creates an instance of a k-nearest neighbors classifier for classification tasks.  
     The `KNeighborsClassifier` is used to model classification tasks based on the proximity of data points in feature space.
