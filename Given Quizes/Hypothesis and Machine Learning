1.What does the hypothesis ‚Ñé(ùë•) represent in machine learning?
Answer: The predicted output based on the input features and model parameters.

1. True or False: A larger hypothesis space always leads to better model performance.
Answer: False
Reasoning: A larger hypothesis space increases the risk of overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and performs poorly on unseen data.

2. True or False: Overfitting occurs when the hypothesis space is too complex for the given data.
Answer: True
Reasoning: Overfitting happens when a model's complexity allows it to memorize the training data rather than generalizing to unseen data, often due to a hypothesis space that is too complex.

3. Scenario Question
Question: You are a data scientist working on a binary classification problem. You have tried two different models. Model A generalizes better to unseen data, while Model B fits the training data almost perfectly but performs poorly on new data.
Answer: Model B, because it fits the training data almost perfectly.
Reasoning: Model B demonstrates overfitting, as it captures the noise and intricacies of the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data. Model A, with its simpler hypothesis space, avoids overfitting and generalizes better.
