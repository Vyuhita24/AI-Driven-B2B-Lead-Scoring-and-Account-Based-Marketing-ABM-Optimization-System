1.What is the key distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning?
  Answer: Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find patterns.

2.Select the correct example of a real-world application for each type of machine learning.
  Answer: Supervised learning in email spam filtering, unsupervised learning in customer segmentation, and reinforcement learning in training self-driving cars.

3.select the correct machine learning type for Supervised learning.
   Answer: Uses labeled data to make predictions based on previously known outcomes.

4.What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?
  Answer:The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data.
  Supervised learning is used when we want to predict a certain outcome from a given input.

5.Select which of the following scenarios are regression problems.
  Answer:Predict how much a company will spend on electricity the next semester.
  Predict the score that a student will achieve in an exam whose grade can be 0.1, 2,..., 10.

6.Select which of the following scenarios are classification problems.
  Answer:Determine whether a customer is likely to purchase more items or not.
  An algorithm is trained to recognize spam email by learning the characteristics of what constitutes spam vs non-spam email.

7.Suppose you want to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a superhero will fly or not.
  Answer:A classification model provides the best approach.

8.True or False: Clustering is a common task in unsupervised learning, where data points are grouped together based on similarity.
  Answer: True

9.Imagine you work for an e-commerce company. The company has a large database of customer transactions, and your task is to segment customers into different groups for targeted marketing. Which unsupervised learning technique would you use?
   Answer: For customer segmentation in e-commerce, you can use clustering algorithms like K-means or hierarchical clustering.

10.You are a financial analyst at a bank and need to detect potentially fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. How could unsupervised learning be applied to identify unusual transaction patterns indicative of fraud?
   Answer: Unsupervised learning can be applied to detect fraudulent transactions by clustering normal and abnormal transaction patterns or using outlier detection methods to identify unusual transaction behavior.
