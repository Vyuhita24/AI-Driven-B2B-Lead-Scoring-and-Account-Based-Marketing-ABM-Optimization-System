Separate the target and features:
X = df.drop(['Unnamed: 32', 'id', 'diagnosis'], axis=1)  
y = df['diagnosis']

Split the data:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

Create KNeighborsClassifier instance:
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier  
knn = KNeighborsClassifier()

Train the model:
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

Make predictions:
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

Calculate f1-score:
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score  
f1_score_test = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
