1. What is the primary goal of machine learning?
->The primary goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks over time.

2. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
->Supervised learning involves training models on labeled data, where the correct answers are provided, and the model learns to map input data to output labels.
->Unsupervised learning analyzes unlabeled data to discover patterns or relationships without explicit output labels.

3. Select two examples of applications for machine learning in real-world scenarios.
->In marketing, machine learning is utilized for customer segmentation, allowing businesses to target specific groups with personalized advertisements.
->Machine learning is applied in healthcare for disease prediction and diagnosis, using patient data to identify potential health issues.

4. Suppose you want to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a superhero will fly or not. Which of the following statements are true?
->A classification model provides the best approach.

5. Select which of the following scenarios are classification problems.
->Determine whether a customer is likely to purchase more items or not
->An algorithm is trained to recognize spam email by learning the characteristics of what constitutes spam vs non-spam email.

6. Select which of the following scenarios are regression problems.
->Predict how much a company will spend on electricity the next semester.
->Predict the score that a student will achieve in an exam whose grade can be 0.1, 2, ..., 10

7. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning? Which of the following statements are true?
->The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data.
->Supervised learning is used when we want to predict a certain outcome from a given input.

8.Why is data gathering a critical first step in the machine learning workflow?
->Data gathering provides the foundation for training and testing models, ensuring they are representative of real-world scenarios.

9. What is the purpose of the training and testing phases in the workflow?
->The purpose of the training and testing phases in the workflow is to ensure that the model can learn patterns from the data and generalize its knowledge to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

10. Why is model evaluation crucial in the machine learning workflow?
->Model evaluation measures the performance of the model and ensures its effectiveness on new, unseen data.
