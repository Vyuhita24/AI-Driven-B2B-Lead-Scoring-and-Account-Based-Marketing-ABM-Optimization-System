Question 1: Which value has the best hyperparameters of max_depth?
From the provided information:
Best hyperparameters:
{'max_depth': 4, 'min_samples_leaf': 4} with a mean score of 0.96
The highest mean score (0.96) corresponds to max_depth = 4.
Answer: 4

Question 2: True or False: For this example, the best hyperparameter obtained is max_depth = 19.
From the results, the best max_depth is 4, not 19. Therefore:
Answer: False
