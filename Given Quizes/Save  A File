1. Select whether this problem is a regression or a classification problem.
Answer: Regression

2. Separate the target and the features into two variables.
Store the features in X and the target y.
X = df.drop(columns=['Sales'])  # Features (Temperature, Advertisement)
y = df['Sales']  # Target variable (Sales)

3. Use train_test_split to split the data into training and testing sets. Split the dataset in 80% training, 20% testing, and random_state=0.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

4. Linear Regression
Create an instance of the LinearRegression model and store it in lr.
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
# Create an instance of LinearRegression
lr = LinearRegression()

5. Train the linear regression model
# Train the model using the training dataset
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

6. Make predictions on the test set
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)
These steps provide a full workflow for preparing the dataset, building and training the model, and making predictions.
