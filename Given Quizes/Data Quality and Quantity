Answer:Supervised learning can be employed to classify customers into groups based on their purchase history and other features, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.

1. Having a large dataset guarantees high data quality.
Answer:
False
Reasoning: A large dataset does not necessarily guarantee high data quality. High-quality data must be accurate, consistent, complete, and relevant, which is independent of its size.

2. Data quality is a subjective term and does not have a universally agreed-upon definition.
Answer:
False
Reasoning: While the specific aspects of data quality may vary based on context, data quality generally refers to the accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and relevance of data, making it more objective than subjective.

3. Scenario: Predicting Student Performance
Question: In this scenario, what would be an example of a high-quality dataset?
Answer:
A. A dataset with accurate and up-to-date information about study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities for a diverse set of students.
Reasoning: High-quality data is accurate, up-to-date, complete, and diverse. Option A meets these criteria and provides meaningful insights for predicting student performance.
